# LittleS Exam App

This repository contains a simple web application that allows you to load exam questions (for example generated by ChatGPT), take the quiz, and see your score along with any wrong answers.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Select a JSON file containing an array of question objects using the file picker. Each question should follow this structure:

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is 2+2?",
    "answers": [
      {"text": "3", "correct": false},
      {"text": "4", "correct": true}
    ]
  }
]
```

3. Click **Start Exam** to begin. Select answers and press **Next** for each question.
4. When finished, your score and a list of any incorrect answers will be displayed.

You can restart the exam to load a new set of questions.
